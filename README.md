# Deadlines and Important Dates 
>Here you can add important dates for the project. You can add them as a whole but I really would like to add upcoming dates (especially deadlines) as a separate section to see it clearly. Of coure it requires a bit discipline to keep in order. You can just copy the lines from below to above. The important thing is don't put everything here (like a meeting and so on). You have your todo list there, and your own calendars for these kind of stuff. Only put important things or big horizons so you don't get lost and it will not clutter your page.

## Todo 
- [X] Yours revises the manuscript
- [ ] NEXT Jane proofreads it
- [ ] TODO John fixes the latex of the paper

- [ ] NEXT John programs the analysis code in R

- [ ] Read Paper C and see if it is related to our experiment.

> Only incomplete tasks and those who are connected to incomplete tasks stay here. If a task is done and not relevant anymore, it should go to log. 
> I use NEXT for the tasks that can be done immediately, TODO for the ones should wait other task to be completed before. One can group them accordingly.
